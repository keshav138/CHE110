They're soft, absorbent, and knowing that they'll break down naturally over time gives me peace of mind. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because they're a bit thinner than I expected, but overall, I'm satisfied with the quality.</p>

It's sturdy, easy to clean, and the fact that it's biodegradable is a huge plus for me. I feel good knowing that I'm using a sustainable product in my kitchen without compromising on quality."</p>

Not only does it provide great protection for my phone, but it also feels good to know that it won't end up sitting in a landfill for centuries. Plus, the design options are stylish and fun!"</p>

They hold up just as well as traditional plastic bags, and I love that they break down naturally over time. The only reason I didn't give them a perfect score is that they're a bit pricier than regular bags, but considering the environmental benefits, I think they're worth it."</p>
